# Predictive-Analysis-Binary-Classifier-with-Tensorflow
How to clean/tidy data, How to build a classifier model with TensorFlow, How to train and how to get final results.


In this repo, I will start from scratch, which means we will handle the data at first: cleaning, tidying the data. 
Then we will start to build our predictive model with oppropriate estimator models from beautiful world of tensorflow.
By having our model is ready, we will have the next step, which is training our model.
Once the training is successfully done, we need to get/see how our model is accurate, so in this case we will have how to have
detailed report.
